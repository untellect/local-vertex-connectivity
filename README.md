# README

The code is implemented as a makefile project. Each algorithm is a standalone command line application that takes an input file and other parameters and outputs a specified number of rows with algorithm running time and cut size.

The compiled algorithms have a two character prefix. The first is "o" for optimisation version (find a cut) or "d" for decision version (find a cut smaller than provided value k). The second is "u" for undirected or "d" for directed input graph.

## Data (Planted cuts)

Graphs with planted cuts (undirected and directed) are generated by generator code in the makefile project. See ./scripts for more.

## Data (Random Hyperbolic Graphs)

Random hyperbolic graphs are pregenerated using [NetworKIT](https://networkit.github.io/) and ./scripts/generators/rhg-gen.py

For the experiments, a number of graphs with the same parameters were generated and the 5 first graphs with the wanted connectivity are chosen. This ensures consistent sample size with the wanted vertex connectivity despite the fact that the generator itself outputs graphs with varying connectivity.

## Data (Real World Networks)

The three real world networks used are from [LiveJournal](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/com-LiveJournal.html), [Epinions.com](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-Epinions1.html) and a web graph of [Berkeley and Stanford](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-BerkStan.html), all part of the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection. The experiments use the largest connected component of k-cores, not the original graphs.
